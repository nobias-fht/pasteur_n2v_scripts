From <code>X</code> we extract <code>mean</code> and <code>std</code> that will be used to normalize all data before it is processed by the network. We also extract the dimensionality and number of channels from <code>X</code>.\n",

    "Compared to supervised training (i.e. traditional CARE), we recommend to use N2V with an increased <code>train_batch_size</code> and <code>batch_norm</code>.\n",
    "To keep the network from learning the identity we have to manipulate the input pixels during training. For this we have the parameter <code>n2v_manipulator</code> with default value <code>'uniform_withCP'</code>. Most pixel manipulators will compute the replacement value based on a neighborhood. With <code>n2v_neighborhood_radius</code> we can control its size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other pixel manipulators:\n",
    "* normal_withoutCP: samples the neighborhood according to a normal gaussian distribution, but without the center pixel\n",
    "* normal_additive: adds a random number to the original pixel value. The random number is sampled from a gaussian distribution with zero-mean and sigma = <code>n2v_neighborhood_radius</code>\n",

    "* identity: performs no pixel manipulation\n",

    "For faster training multiple pixels per input patch can be manipulated. In our experiments we manipulated about 0.198% of the input pixels per patch. For a patch size of 64 by 64 pixels this corresponds to about 8 pixels. This fraction can be tuned via <code>n2v_perc_pix</code>.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the past we experienced bleedthrough artifacts between channels if training was terminated to early. To counter bleedthrough we added the `single_net_per_channel` option, which is turned on by default. In the back a single U-Net for each channel is created and trained independently, thereby removing the possiblity of bleedthrough. <br/>\n",
    "__Note:__ Essentially the network gets multiplied by the number of channels, which increases the memory requirements. If your GPU gets too small, you can always split the channels manually and train a network for each channel one after another."
